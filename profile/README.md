The **Santander Meteorology Group** is formed by professors and researchers from the
University of Cantabria (UC, Dept. of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science) and the
National Research Council (CSIC, Instituto de FÃ­sica de Cantabria - IFCA),
conducting research in topics related to weather forecasting, climate research,
data mining and high-performance computing, and spatiotemporal chaotic systems.

We are committed to the
