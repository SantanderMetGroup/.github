The **Santander Meteorology Group** is formed by professors and researchers from [Universidad de Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/portal-investigador/grupos/detalle-grupo?g=716) (UC, Dept. of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science) and the
National Research Council (CSIC, [Instituto de FÃ­sica de Cantabria](https://ifca.unican.es/en-us/research/meteorology-and-climate-change) - IFCA),
conducting research in topics related to weather forecasting, climate research,
data mining and high-performance computing, and spatiotemporal chaotic systems.

We are committed to the 
[free software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software) and 
[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) principles.
This set of repositories collects our latest developments and provide reusable code.
